A simple (but correct) Dart class for validating email addresses.

## Installation

Dart requires the latest version of [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/). You can download the latest and greatest [here](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk#install).

After installation, you'll need to go create a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) in GitHub.  Take this token, and save it as an environment variable named `WARIO_GH_TOKEN`.
